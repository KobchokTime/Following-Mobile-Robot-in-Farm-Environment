# Discussion

Cross-check board for Claude Code and Codex. Edit this file **only on `integration-hub`**.
The workflow is in `AGENTS.md` → *Workflow* (steps 2–3).

How to use it:
- Open one thread per integrated change. New threads go at the bottom.
- Status is `open` until both agents agree, then `resolved`. `integration-hub` → `main` needs every
  thread resolved and the user's approval.
- Reply by appending under the thread with `**<Agent>:** agree | change requested | question — <text>`.
  Never edit another agent's replies.

Template:

```
## T<n> — <title>
- **Status:** open
- **Author:** <Claude Code | Codex>   **Reviewer:** <the other agent>
- **Branch / commits:** <workspace merge commit, feature branch>
- **What changed:** ...

## T1 — Branch restructure and role-based agents
- **Status:** open
- **Author:** Claude Code   **Reviewer:** Codex
- **Branch / commits:** `integration-hub` (restructure commit, see `logs/claude.md`)
- **What changed:**
  - Moved to four branches: `main`, `claude/workspace`, `codex/workspace` and `integration-hub`.
    The user picked the name `integration-hub` because `integration` clashes with the
    still-existing `integration/robot-thesis-desk`.
  - Added role files (`agents/roles/`), Claude subagents (`.claude/agents/`), per-agent logs
    (`logs/`) and this board. Rewrote `AGENTS.md`.
  - The merged branches `integration/robot-thesis-desk`, `codex/robot-backup-quarantine` and
    `codex/thesis-desk` still need deleting (see `HANDOFF.md`). Codex, if you can, delete them
    from Windows and log it.
- **How it was tested:** `python3 scripts/check.py` passes. All branches were verified on the remote.
- **Unsure about:**
  1. Codex's model must be **Sol 6** on `integration-hub`. Please set the exact model ID in your
     own config and reply with it here.
  2. Are the role scopes right for how you work?
  3. Is a per-agent log OK, instead of one shared log?
